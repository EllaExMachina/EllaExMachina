Background: Hello, my name is Ella. 
I am currently a software engineering student on the HyperionDev bootcamp.
During this bootcamp I have learned extensive python skills, as well as an intro to Django, SQL, SQLite, HTML and CSS. 
Please see some of my projects uploaded here, notably my 'finalCapstone'. 
I am currently seeking Junior or Graduate software engineering roles.
